# Database-Filler
A simple PHP file with arrays and simple functions which can be used to populate a database. Add more functions as you like. Simply create an instance of this file in your test.php or index.php files, and then call its' functions while you're testing your DAO layer.
Thanks to https://gist.github.com/brysonian/99430 and https://gist.github.com/subodhghulaxe/8148971 for the arrays.
